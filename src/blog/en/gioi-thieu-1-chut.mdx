Hello everyone! It’s been so long since I last sat down to write a blog post. I'm not saying this to make my articles sound more special, haha, I just really miss the feeling of sitting down and focusing on writing something. A lot has happened recently, my mental state hasn't been stable, and my health hasn't been great, but I've managed to get things sorted out lately. On the occasion of launching my new personal blog, I'm writing this post to introduce it, as well as to give a brief summary of my current situation.
<br/>
I’m sure most of you know about my illness. The post about my condition that I shared on Facebook was luckily read by many, but sadly I can't transfer those comments to this blog. I am still incredibly grateful to everyone because I’ve been using that support as motivation to try hard every day since then.
<br/>
Regarding my health, I went through a bone marrow transplant, but the situation hasn't improved. I still need blood transfusions more often than usual, even more than before the transplant. Sounds sad, right? That’s the negative side. Additionally, I’m also affected by the side effects of medication. I recently suffered from acute kidney failure, stage two, but thankfully I have recovered now. My blood count is still low as before, but I feel much weaker now than before the transplant. My blood pressure also fluctuates erratically, but generally, it's higher than before, so I have to monitor it more carefully. However, I’m still trying to live positively and optimistically (I really try!). When I’m free at home, I sit down to code, watch movies, read books, read comics, recite Buddha's name, meditate, do light exercises, and more... Throughout this time being ill, I’ve received a lot of encouragement from everyone. I'm very happy, and I want to send my sincere thanks to all of you.
<br/>
As for this personal blog, I've spent a lot of time working on it. I plan to write about many different topics, from daily life, personal experiences, thoughts on social issues, technology, programming, books, movies, and more... I’m not stressing over having to write regularly or follow a specific schedule; I just want to write when I feel I have something to share. (Besides, I also want to show off my talent! If any of you think I code well and need a website, feel free to hire me! I'll take on any web project, from design to coding ^^). I hope this blog will become a place where I can freely express myself and connect with people who share similar interests.
<br/>
Partly, it’s also because I often feel down. I may claim to be positive, but everyone has their sad moments. I'm at home and don't have many people to talk to, so I thought writing something and posting it would be nice. I post it, I invest in the writing, and I am sincere, yet I feel embarrassed to reread my own work, haha. But I still really enjoy hearing feedback from everyone about my articles. If you want to share your own thoughts or have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me. I’ve included the contact button <Link to={`/vn/contact`} className="font-bold underline">đây</Link>.

I wrote this article to share with those of you who live far from home, what I write will help you control your emotions, become more energetic and loving, reduce negative impacts from life, and a little love revelation.
<br/>
Just a few days ago, I shared my article that won 3rd prize in the Physics Champion contest. I had called my mom before, but today, while I was studying, I suddenly received a text message from my mom. I burst into tears.
<br/>
I am sure my mother must have tried very hard to send me this message. My mother did not go to school since she was young, and has been poor since she was a child. She can read and write, but very little, her number is the same. When I was still at home with my mother, she asked me to help her write envelopes or calculate her salary. Now that I am away at school, I realize how hard my mother tried to write a message to comfort me, I can't help but cry.
<br/>
My middle school literature teacher, who was my neighbor, told me in class how my mother gave birth to me. She said that morning my mother went to the yard to pick vegetables, around noon she had a stomachache, everyone took her to the hospital, in the afternoon she saw my mother carrying me home, she said I was like a gift from heaven. I asked my mother again, she said giving birth to me was very easy, my father went to work that morning, but when he came back he saw me already at home. (Because at that time our family only had one landline phone so my father didn't know). My mother said that raising me was also very easy, I just couldn't eat spicy food, I wasn't picky about anything else, and if I ate, I grew up very quickly.
<br/>
My sister and I grew up in a not-so-peaceful family. We often had to endure our parents' quarrels. And the pressure of studying and getting good grades was also a huge pressure on us. My family was a farmer, our parents did not hire more workers because the income was not enough, due to lack of manpower, my sister and I started working in the garden very early, I started working in the garden before I went to school, and when I was in primary school, I was able to help my parents with the gardening. When we were young, if we had a school schedule, we would go to school, and on days off, when we did not go to school, we would go to the field to help our parents with the gardening.
<br/>
Although life is hard, my studies are still quite good. However, until now, I still don't know what my parents' standards for studying well are. My mother's message yesterday was the first comforting message I received during my entire time at school. Before going to school, my father or mother had never praised me for being a good student. As long as my phone score was below 8, no matter what subject, my mother and father would call and ask why my studies were failing. But I have never given up because of that. Studying can be a talent of mine. I inherited good genes from my parents, so my studies are quite good. Besides, for me, studying is not only my duty to myself, but also to my parents and society. Besides, my parents still have hope in me. I realize that, I understand that, so no matter how much they complain or curse, I still have the motivation to try. I attached a photo to prove that my efforts somehow bring me happiness.
<br/>
I grew up like that, the dirt of life could not negatively affect my perspective on life. Looking back now, I see that I am really good, really good, I rate myself like this: physical body 9 points, soul, spirit 9.5 points, intelligence 8.5 points. And I will share a way to have a peaceful, stable soul no matter how many waves life throws at you like me.
<br/>
First, you and I must understand each other's circumstances. You must admit that you have gone through enough suffering to understand your feelings. Only then will you have faith in what I say, and you will believe that what I say will really help you. For me, the time at home is really lonely. The family is not happy, internal quarrels that cannot be resolved by words are completely unhealthy environments for development. If life were miserable but in return I had a warm, happy family, I would be more mature than now, but I have no right to choose what circumstances will happen to me. I cannot share the bad things at school with my parents, even if I try to tell them, the one who gets scolded is still me. When I went to school, I had to try my best to study, and at the same time, I also had to try my best not to be hated by my friends. My parents didn't give me money for snacks, so I couldn't get along with my friends very well. It wasn't uncommon for me to be separated and sit alone in one place. During my first years of kindergarten and primary school, my family had conflicts with the school, so the teachers who taught me didn't love me as much as the other kids. For me, it was a big disadvantage, an indescribable loneliness. If I was bullied or beaten in class, I wouldn't dare say anything when I got home. If I was beaten 5 times in class, I would tell my parents and get beaten 10 times. I was like that, my sister was even worse. In contrast to me, she wasn't good at studying, and she had absolutely no friends in class. If I was just "no one to play with", she was "hated by many friends". She once beat her friend to protect me, and then was dragged home by that friend's sister to be beaten by her mother. I witnessed everything but couldn't do anything. In addition to studying, I also had to go to work to help my parents. On days when I didn't know how to do new things, did them slowly, did them wrong, or didn't have the energy to do them, I was scolded, tired from work, and even beaten. During the time I went to school near home, my studies and friends improved, but they were still bad, but what was worse was that my family life became more and more tense and stressful. My parents often argued with each other. Now they're better, but they still argue. Sometimes, while I'm writing this article at home, my parents are still arguing. Those of you who have experienced it will understand how stressful and difficult it is to have a family that isn't peaceful. Sometimes, I also had suicidal thoughts, but luckily, I was afraid of not doing the stupid things I thought of. I'll only tell you this much, hoping it's enough to sympathize with the situation you're facing.
<br/>
I still have an important story to tell before giving the solution, which is how I overcame those things? In short, I went to school far from home, and not being exposed to a negative environment gave me time to reflect and learn many new things. Now, answer yourself: since the day you left your house in the countryside to study in the city, have you enjoyed it more, why do you enjoy it, do you consider being far from home, living and dying alone in a place that is not your home a freedom, do you allow yourself to do things you have never done before, and are you happy, proud, and excited when doing those things? When you left your family, what was your attitude towards your parents at home, were you more irritable with them, did you hang up on them when talking to them? I also made my parents sad and worried a lot because of those times, but maybe because I was lucky, I experienced it early, in a safe environment, surrounded by honest and innocent people, so I soon realized and changed. What I want to tell everyone is my high school. I rented a room near the school for convenience in commuting and studying, because my high school was quite far from home, it was not convenient to go back and forth constantly. Because I studied at a specialized school, my roommates also came from farming and teaching families, not arrogant, reasonable, understanding, loving each other, so I was not enticed or drawn into unhealthy things, on the contrary, I learned how to give love and think positively. When I first left my parents' arms, I was still very good, but then I realized that I had never tried anything before, and the desire to experience arose in me. I was no longer as good as before. I started to feel uncomfortable when my parents kept calling to discipline me, forcing me to do this and that, while I thought I could take care of myself well. There was a time when my anger reached its peak, I turned off my mother's phone, regardless of what she thought, at that time I didn't care. But then I grew up, I felt humiliated and ashamed when I saw the good relationships between my mother and my roommates, that was the first time in my life, I thought about my mother's feelings. Maybe you just haven't gone through this stage yet, but I'm here partly to help you realize this sooner, this can help you not regret anymore, help your life be more meaningful, worth living. Thinking of my mother, I realized how stupid I was. What good child would disobey their parents so quickly? What good child would not think about their parents, just live by instinct, get angry when they hate, turn on when they don't like it, turn off the phone when they don't like it? And yet I'm still proud of being a good child to my parents. So what is the correct solution?
<br/>
(I added this part so that no one misunderstands my mother, because my mother did not have a happy family, so her way of loving may be a bit strange, but I know and I still understand and sympathize with her about this)
<br/>
First of all, you must realize the love and gratitude that your parents have for you. Think about it, are you always the object of your parents' love? When you live far away from home, are your parents sometimes angry because you forget to call home? Do your parents often call to ask about your health and your studies? All of that care and concern comes from your parents' boundless love for you. You are the one who is happy to receive that love, so it is your duty to repay those favors. From the simplest things, try asking yourself that if you have children in the future, what will you be happy when your children do? Filial piety is certainly indispensable. A father's joy is to see his children grow up, can you show him what you have learned, what lessons have become valuable, what achievements have you made in your studies? Your mother's joy will be your care, sharing, seeing you eat well, sleep well, healthy, not sick, she also cares about the relationships around you, so show your mother that she can completely rest assured about you, that you can completely take good care of yourself even when living far from home or when lacking their care.

<br/>
Remember that the meaning of taking good care of yourself is much greater than you imagine. When you are taken care of, your parents at home feel more secure, when your parents feel secure, they can focus on doing other things to continue raising you, you also complete part of your filial piety. I am sure you realize more than what I said, and when you apply it, you know that caring for yourself, loving yourself is also loving your parents. I myself have a healthy body like now thanks to that thinking, the proof is that since Tet until now I have only lost 1kg, but when my mother knows she still asks me why I eat and drink to lose weight, that means I still have to try harder so that she does not worry. I have provided you with the key that I mentioned at the beginning of the article, this is really a great motivation, right? You control your emotions to avoid unexpected things, that means you have made your parents feel more secure. When love and life become difficult for you, you can still take good care of yourself, because you think of your parents, you cannot let yourself be hurt, you find a way to escape, that is a very smart way to apply what I said.
<br/>
*Loyalty, Filial Piety, Harmony*  
“Among the three, which honors the father?  
Loyalty for the father, Filial piety for the mother, Harmony for the siblings.”
<br/>
There is one thing that I am very interested in. To me, love is really important, really noble. I have watched many lectures by Ms. Thanh Hoai Thanh. I like to hear her talk about love. Love is not just an expression of emotion, love that originates from emotion is difficult to last, and long-lasting, but true love also needs to have human affection. Emotions are easy to have, easy to lose, easy to change. If today you have feelings for this person, tomorrow you can completely have feelings for another person. Affection is different, like when you meet someone who silently follows and loves you, you realize the sacrifices that person makes, you love and feel sorry for them, then you will never forget them. So the true love that accompanies us for decades, even hundreds of years cannot come from emotions alone. So what is love? It is understanding each other, sacrificing for each other, knowing how to sympathize, tolerate, and share each other's mistakes. Only then will we be strong enough to go through storms together and live for each other for a lifetime. So please differentiate, don't foolishly believe in emotions that don't come from deep gratitude and then bring pain to those who bring that love and gratitude. No need to think far, the closest people who bring that love and gratitude are our parents. Just by scratching our skin, we can see our parents getting feverish, or simply falling and fighting. Those are just physical pains, but the mental suffering that we have, our parents suffer many times more. This may be a little more difficult, but imagine you have a younger sister, a younger brother, or later you have children, do you feel pain, do you feel sorry when you see your child, your younger brother in pain, do you have the heart to let outside injuries affect them. Yet there are still people who can even hurt themselves just because of someone on the street, that is unacceptable. Absolutely do not believe and then fall in love with someone, sacrifice for someone and accept pain for someone just because of material things or temporary emotions. You should only do those things with people and only with people who have enough love and gratitude for you. 
<br/>
Through Ms. Thanh Hoai Thanh's lecture, I want you to know how to find and create a love, a stronger, more lasting, more beautiful external relationship, and I also want you to show more love, show more gratitude, and repay those who have always given you love and kindness. If you can't do anything for them, let them know that you know better than them, and one day you will repay their kindness, don't be silent or wait any longer. To live is to know how to look above, look below, look at those you give to, and also look at those who give to you. Having looked at and received from them, you must have the responsibility and obligation to repay them, that is the way of life, that is the way of being a child, of being a human. Give kindness, receive kindness. The desire to develop yourself to bring value to others, to help people and the community, that is the true motivation, that is the eternal engine that helps you to be more successful in life, that is the origin, the truth of development and evolution. Believe in yourself, the words you say, above all you are the one who applies, the one who experiences, the one who tests and the one who receives the results that it brings. You have a great source of motivation to do everything you set out to do, you stand firmer in the face of life's difficulties, you do not get lost or fall. Towards others but you can live with yourself, we only receive when we give, so do not think with our inherent selfishness, control your instincts, think further, puff out your chest, turn your heart outward more, then you will be the one to realize that the experiences you talk about are still nothing compared to what you can do and receive.
<br/>
I just said that I experienced what living for others brought to me, but I did not say that I have a meaningful love, beautiful like in a painting. That love is my wish, and Ms. Thanh helps me have more faith and motivation to develop, live beautifully to be more worthy of it.
I put a lot of my attitude into the article, certainly this time the article will not be soft and follow everyone. But please whoever reads this article do not pay attention to it, instead pay attention to the values ​​that I want to bring, want everyone to receive. That is the best expression of deep gratitude to me. Through the article, if you find that we have the same ideals or the same frequency, do not hesitate to let me know, maybe you and I will create more values. Also, do not hesitate to comment to give me your opinion.
<br/>
I wrote this post, my mother is the biggest motivation, so I really want everyone's help to get the most interactions for this post.
<br/>
Finally, I wish you all good health, joy, lots of energy, love to overcome difficulties and achieve success and complete happiness. Sending hundreds of words of love.
